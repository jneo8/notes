## Optimizing for User Experience with Data Science and Machine Learning
- 人與人之間, 人與機器之間 要有什麼樣的互動
- 是否有在push forward 社會
- improve user experience
    - Measure -> optimize -> impact

- social media 
    - 建立人與人connection 的 tool
    - 語言的隔閡
    - 大部分的人都follow 最popular 的人
    - different between twitter & facebook, 做朋友需要別人同意
    - Why did you wnat to climb MountEverest?
        - Because it's there.

    - 目的
        - connecting people across the word
        - challenge: 
            - Connect across lumpy 
            - both structurally and across language barriers.


    - different social medie 有不同的結果(國家)
    - 如何真正conn user?
        - AI

- The Recommendation Problem
    - user + context = item 
        - very hard.
    
    - Use RNN
        - RNN model with time.
        - attention mechanism

    - We don't represent user/items equally
    - Force learning 
        - Force selection
        - Approach
        - High-Level approach

        - force group & unforce group

- The Lesson
 - major the problem is work
 - Optimization in the real world is complex
